Atomicity (from Java Concurrency in Practice book)

"Operations A and B are atomic with respect to each other 
if, from the perspective of a thread executing A, 
when another thread executes B, 
either all of B has executed or none of it has. 
An atomic operation is one that is atomic 
with respect to all operations, including itself, 
that operate on the same state."
